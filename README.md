## Profile

* I am in the EAP concentration

## Description of the course project ideas and objectives for the class
My interests are Environmental Justice issues like urban heat effects and housing justice. EJ is very broad so I look forward to seeing what kind of project I can explore and integrate spatial data research work. My goal for this class is to learn the basics of python coding and spatial data science. :earth_americas:
